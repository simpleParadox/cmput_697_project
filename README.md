# CMPUT 697 Project
In this project, we apply different clustering algorithms to an Amazon review dataset.

The dataset is available at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/amazon-product-reviews-dataset).

## Goal
The goal of this project is to apply various clustering algorithms to different embedding types and compare their performance.

What motivated this project?
Customer reviews are important for businesses. They help businesses understand their customers and improve their products. However, there are instances, 
where the ratings of the amazon reviews do not reflect the actual sentiment of the review text. For example, a review with a rating of 2 may actually have a review text that might
be better suited for a 4 star rating. 
In this project, we choose to look at a question that is a prerequisite to this problem. We ask the question, "What types of embeddings can we use to best represent the 
review text, and how does the choice of embedding affect the performance of various clustering algorithms?"


## Run the experiments.
To run the experiments, you need to have the following packages installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- gensim
- gradio (v3.23.0)
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- torch

Please install these packages according to your operating system and 
package manager.

This project was built using anaconda.



## Demo
To run the demo on your local machine, run the following command:
```
python gradio_app.py
```
